# Exercise-06d-Unit-Testing

Exercise for MSCH-C220

A simple example of Unit Testing, using GUT. Implements (and auto-runs) the test_example.gd suite. 2 tests should pass, and 3 should fail.

Any script (that follows the applicable conventions) in the res://test/unit or res://test/integration will be run when the project is played.

## Implementation

 - Built using Godot 3.5
 - [GUT](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) can be installed via the Asset Library or downloaded from GitHub.
